a. What is an issue
An issue is a way to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, bugs, or other types of information in a GitHub repository. It serves as a communication tool among the repository's contributors, allowing them to discuss changes or report problems. Issues can be assigned, labeled, and commented on, and they may also have milestones or deadlines associated with them.


b. What is a pull request?
A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another branch (typically the main branch). When you create a pull request, it allows others to review your code, discuss changes, and suggest improvements before merging the changes into the main codebase. It is a collaborative tool used to ensure code quality and facilitate communication.
